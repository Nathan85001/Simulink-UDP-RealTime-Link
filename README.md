# Simulink-UDP-RealTime-Link
This repository provides a framework for establishing a real-time UDP connection between two PCs on the same WiFi network using Simulink. The project aims to facilitate seamless communication and data exchange between remote systems, leveraging Simulink's capabilities for real-time simulation and control.
